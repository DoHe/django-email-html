Application substitutes built-in ``send_mail`` function by new smart ``send_mail`` function

old: send_mail(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list, fail_silently=False, auth_user=None, auth_password=None, connection=None)
new: send_mail(subject, message, from_email=None, recipient_list=None, fail_silently=False, auth_user=None, auth_password=None, connection=None)

With few new features:

* message attribute using for html or plain-test message body. If it contains html, plain-text is generating automatically basing on html body;
* from_email attribute is not required. By default it will be equal to ``settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``;
* Depending on ``settings.EMAIL_ADMIN_DUPLICATE`` all copies of email messages also sending to ``ADMIN`` emails (using bcc header);

Using:

    send_mail(subj, html, recipient_list=emails)

Requirements:

* BeautifulSoup
* w3m (for generating plain-text from html)

Important things:

* Place ``email_html`` application in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` before all other applications, which sending emails, that you need to make html based by default;
* Html body must contains <html> tag, otherwise function would think this is a plain-text body;
